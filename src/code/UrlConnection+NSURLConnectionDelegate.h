The main purpose is to break the code base for  * UrlConnection up into managable units. In this case we have a collection of delegate methods from NSURLConnection  * which handle the responses from a url.  *   * There is not a lot of code  * here. Most of it is around two things: connection:didReceiveData: which is used to assemble the text contained  * within an xml tag. And  * connection:canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: which handles certificates and ssl security.  */@interface UrlConnection (NSURLConnectionDelegate)- (NSURLRequest *) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection willSendRequest: (NSURLRequest *) request redirectResponse: (NSURLResponse *) response;- (BOOL) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection canAuthenticateAgainstProtectionSpace: (NSURLProtectionSpace *) protectionSpace;- (NSInputStream *) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection needNewBodyStream: (NSURLRequest *) request;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didReceiveAuthenticationChallenge: (NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *) challenge;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didCancelAuthenticationChallenge: (NSURLAuthenticationChallenge *) challenge;- (BOOL) connectionShouldUseCredentialStorage: (NSURLConnection *) connection;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didReceiveResponse: (NSURLResponse *) response;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didReceiveData: (NSData *) data;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didSendBodyData: (NSInteger) bytesWritten totalBytesWritten: (NSInteger) totalBytesWritten totalBytesExpectedToWrite: (NSInteger) totalBytesExpectedToWrite;- (void) connectionDidFinishLoading: (NSURLConnection *) connection;- (void) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection didFailWithError: (NSError *) error;- (NSCachedURLResponse *) connection: (NSURLConnection *) connection willCacheResponse: (NSCachedURLResponse *) cachedResponse;@end
